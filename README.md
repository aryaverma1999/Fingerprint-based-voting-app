# Finger-authenticated-voting-system

The project is about using JAVA programming language to improve the voting system in India. People in India does not go for casting the vote.There could be different reason for the same, which lead to seletion of party not by majority but minority of those who gives time for casting vote. 
To improve the situation and increase the number of voters, This project can do wonders.

I as the leader of team with my two collage mate, Introduce a new concept of using fingerprint of user for voting purpose. Basic idea was to develop an mobile application as well as an evm(with fingerprint scanner). The citizen with busy life can cast vote using the mobile application and one with no such faclity can go to the voting booth. 

NOTE:= Due to lack of funding this project is just an prototype showing that this could be very efficient and effictive. 


ADVANTAGE:- 

There could be no bugging of system as one vote can be casted per person. 

There would be reduce in buying of votes as people would cast vote from the office or home. 

It is easy to set up and long lasting solution.
